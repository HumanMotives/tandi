  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
    The Data Grave is a <strong>mischievous final resting place</strong> for your unfinished audio ideas. 
    Why let those half-baked loops rot on your hard drive and weigh on your soul? 
    Let them go! Who knows — they might find a second life in someone else’s project.
  </p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a file and drop it into the grave.</li>
    <li>Choose its fate: <strong>Bury</strong> or <strong>Cremate</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add a personal epitaph.</li>
    <li>Let it go.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Your entry will appear on the public listing — a permanent memorial to your sad little creation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bury:</strong> Your file is submitted under our license and may be resurrected 
      by others in their own work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cremate:</strong> Nothing is actually uploaded (<em>pinky swear!</em>) — you just 
      get to enjoy the site’s dark humor without sharing anything for real.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Origins of the Data Grave</h2>
  <p>
    The Data Grave is a small passion project by me, <strong>Chris van der Linden</strong> — musician 
    (<em>Human Motives</em>), designer, and all-round creative who loves exploring new ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started as a tongue-in-cheek experiment: a fake “graveyard” where nothing was really uploaded or deleted 
    (though many thought it was). That misunderstanding was part of the fun — it asked, 
    <q>What if you truly let go of your unfinished work? How would that feel?</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    To my surprise, people loved it. They wanted to actually hear what others had buried, and even reuse those loops themselves. 
    That’s how this new, resurrected version was born.
  </p>

  <h2>Why so serious?</h2>
  <p>
    The Data Grave isn’t a business, a money-making scheme, or a sneaky way to steal music. 
    It’s my personal creative outlet — a place to share a laugh, spark inspiration, 
    and embrace the beautiful absurdity of unfinished ideas.
