   <h1>Using The Data Grave (License)</h1>

<h2>License Information</h2>
  
<p>
At The Data Grave you can bury or cremate your unfinished music and loops. Trust us, it feels relieving! <strong>“Bury”</strong> means you are uploading your unfinished music and permanently releasing it under the <em>Data Grave Burial License</em>. Once buried, others can listen, download and use your file to create something new, even commercially. But only as long as they stay within the limits of this license. 
<strong>The “Cremate”</strong> option means the file is never actually uploaded — and thus is not audible to others. We have kept the Cremate option to allow you to enjoy the humoristic aspects of our site, without comitting your work to our license. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
When you bury your unfinished music here, you’re doing more than just uploading a file.  
You’re setting it free — <i>forever</i>.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
By choosing <strong>Bury</strong>, you confirm you own the rights to the audio and agree to release it under the <strong>Data Grave Burial License</strong>.  
This means:<br><br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Freedom:</strong> Anyone may download and use buried audio <em>only</em> as part of a modified or derivative work, in personal or commercial projects.</li>
  <li><strong>No Raw Resale:</strong> You may not resell, rehost, or redistribute the original, unmodified audio file in its raw form.</li>
  <li><strong>No Attribution Required:</strong> Others are not required to credit you, though they may choose to voluntarily.</li>
  <li><strong>No Takebacks:</strong> Once buried, your audio is permanently released under this license.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Uploader Warranty:</strong> You confirm you own the rights to the audio and that it does not infringe on any third-party copyrights.
</p>

<h2>Why This License?</h2>
<p>
The spirit of The Data Grave is to let go of unfinished work. No more sitting on your hard drive gathering dust — instead, it can live on in other people’s projects, evolve into new forms, and maybe even inspire something amazing.
