   <h1>Using The Data Grave (License)</h1>

<h2>License Information – Setting Your Audio Free</h2>

<p>
At The Data Grave, <strong>“Bury”</strong> means you are uploading your unfinished music and permanently releasing it under the <em>Data Grave Burial License</em>.  
<strong>“Cremate”</strong> means the file is never uploaded — it remains private, is not audible to others, and is never covered by this license.
</p>

<p>
When you bury your unfinished music here, you’re doing more than just uploading a file.  
You’re setting it free — <i>forever</i>.
</p>

<p>
By choosing <strong>Bury</strong>, you confirm you own the rights to the audio and agree to release it under the <strong>Data Grave Burial License</strong>.  
This means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Freedom:</strong> Anyone may download and use buried audio <em>only</em> as part of a modified or derivative work, in personal or commercial projects.</li>
  <li><strong>No Raw Resale:</strong> You may not resell, rehost, or redistribute the original, unmodified audio file in its raw form.</li>
  <li><strong>No Attribution Required:</strong> Others are not required to credit you, though they may choose to voluntarily.</li>
  <li><strong>No Takebacks:</strong> Once buried, your audio is permanently released under this license.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Uploader Warranty:</strong> You confirm you own the rights to the audio and that it does not infringe on any third-party copyrights.
</p>

<h2>Why This License?</h2>
<p>
The spirit of The Data Grave is to let go of unfinished work. No more sitting on your hard drive gathering dust — instead, it can live on in other people’s projects, evolve into new forms, and maybe even inspire something amazing.
