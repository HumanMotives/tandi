    <h1>Using The Data Grave (License)</h1>

    <h2>License Information</h2>

    <p>At The Data Grave you can <strong>Bury</strong> or <strong>Cremate</strong> your unfinished music and loops. Trust us, it will feel great!</p>
<br>
      <strong>“Bury”</strong> = your file is actually uploaded and permanently released under the
      <em>Data Grave Burial License</em> (DGBL). Once buried, others can listen, download, and use your file to create something new, even commercially — within the limits of this license. 
When you choose to Bury, your track doesn’t rot on a lonely hard drive — it may rise again, immortalized in the projects of others.</p>
      <br />
      <strong>“Cremate”</strong> = your file is <em>not actually</em> uploaded, is <em>is not</em> audible to others, and is<em>never</em> covered by this license. Cremate exists so you can enjoy the site’s dark humor without offering up your work.
    </p>

    <h3 id="dgbl">Data Grave Burial License (DGBL) — Summary</h3><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use Freedom:</strong> Anyone may download and use buried audio <em>only</em> as part of a
        <em>modified or derivative work</em>, for personal or commercial projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Resale of Original files:</strong> You may not resell, rehost, share, or redistribute the original,
        unmodified audio file “as‑is” (including bundling it into sample packs or libraries).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Attribution Required:</strong> Credit is appreciated but not required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Irrevocable:</strong> Once buried, the license for that file cannot be revoked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Uploader Warranty:</strong> By burying, you confirm you own the rights to the audio and that it
        does not infringe any third‑party rights.
      </li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h3>Definitions (Plain English)</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Modified or derivative work:</strong> You meaningfully change the audio (e.g., edit, slice,
        pitch/tempo change, layer, remix, resample, process, or incorporate it into a larger work such as a song,
        film, game, podcast, or soundscape).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Original file:</strong> The original download exactly as provided (or trivially altered versions such as
        re-encodes with no creative change).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This License?</h2>
    <p>
      The spirit of The Data Grave is to let go of unfinished work. Instead of gathering dust on a hard drive, it
      can live on in other people’s projects, evolve into new forms, and maybe even inspire something amazing—
      without enabling copy‑paste reselling of the original file.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Can I use a buried track in my commercial project?</strong><br />
      Yes—so long as you’re using it as part of a <em>modified or derivative work</em>, not as an unmodified,
      standalone track.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Can I upload someone else’s track?</strong><br />
      No. You must own the rights. If you see something that shouldn’t be here, please contact us for removal.
    </p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>Can I redistribute the original files elsewhere?</strong><br />
      No. You cannot rehost, resell, or bundle the raw files (including in sample packs). Link to The Data Grave
      instead.
